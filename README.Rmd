The goal of `annotater` is to annotate package load calls in character strings and R/Rmd files, so we can have an idea of the overall purpose of the libraries we're loading.

### What do my loaded packages do?

### Where did I get them?

The two annotation types are also available together:

Thanks to [Juan Cruz Rodriguez](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989), we can now annotate which functions from each package are being called in a script.

## `pacman` compatibility

Users of the [`pacman`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pacman) package can now use all `annotater` functions on `p_load` calls. This includes calls with multiple package names (e.g. `p_load(ggplot2,purrr)`), which will be split up across lines for readability.

## Installation

Install the development version of `annotater` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("luisDVA/annotater")
```
Restart RStudio after the installation for the addins to load properly.

### When using the addins, make sure the focus (blinking cursor) is on an open RStudio R file in the 'source' pane.

## Example

These are the possible annotations, which can be added to character strings (with one line per element), or applied to .R or .Rmd files in RStudio through their corresponding addins.

```r
library(annotater)
test_string <-c("library(boot)\nrequire(Matrix)")
writeLines(annotate_pkg_calls(test_string))
writeLines(annotate_repo_source(test_string))
writeLines(annotate_repo_source(test_string))
```

Entire .R files can also be parsed and annotated with the `annotate_script` function.
