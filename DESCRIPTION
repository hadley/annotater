Title: Annotate Package Load Calls
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Luis D.",
           family = "Verde Arregoitia",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "luis@liomys.mx",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-9520-6543"))
Description: Similar to styler. Provides non-invasive annotation of package load calls 
    such as \code{library} and \code{require} so that we can have an idea of what 
    the packages we're loading are meant for.
